  {
    question: "Do I need to log in?",
    answer: "No. SolveX uses only public data from the Codeforces API. You enter your handle and we fetch your public submissions, verdicts, and problem tags. No OAuth, no token, no account required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does SolveX use private Codeforces data?",
    answer: "No. We only use publicly available data — your submissions, verdicts, problem metadata, and tags. Everything we analyze is accessible to anyone on the Codeforces website without logging in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this machine learning?",
    answer: "No. SolveX uses rule-based heuristic analysis — specific formulas and thresholds to identify patterns. There is no neural network, no LLM, no training data. Every output is explainable.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the diagnosis?",
    answer: "It depends on your submission history. More problems, more reliable patterns. Codeforces tags are also noisy — a problem tagged 'constructive' may be more about math or greedy. We show confidence levels and always recommend treating results as hypotheses to test, not ground truth.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why can solved topics still appear as friction areas?",
    answer: "Solved rate alone does not indicate friction. A topic where you solved 100/100 problems but needed 5 attempts on average, or accumulated heavy WA counts, still represents a training gap. SolveX weights retry cost, WA density, and TLE frequency — not just AC rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is SkillTrace?",
    answer: "SkillTrace is a coming feature that will verify improvement by recording the process of solving — not just whether you got AC, but how many attempts it took, what errors appeared, and how your code evolved. It is not live yet.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is SolveX free?",
    answer: "Yes. SolveX is fully free during the beta period. No credit card, no trial timer, no hidden limits. We will be transparent before anything changes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who built SolveX?",
    answer: "SolveX is built by Bekarys Kydyrbekov, a competitive programmer from Kazakhstan. It started as a personal tool to diagnose why rating gains stalled, and grew from there.",
  },
